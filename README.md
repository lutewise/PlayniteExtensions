Extensions for Playnite by Lutewise

## ExoDosLibrary
It is a library plugin for importing [eXoDOS and Win3xO](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/6stkzb/exodos_win3xo_projects_open_directory_share/) 
games to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

Developed in accordance to what is described in the [plugin development tutorial by Josef Nemec](https://playnite.link/docs/tutorials/plugins/libraryPlugins.html). 

*ExoDosLibrary* imports eXoDOS game references from MEAGRE metadata, currently without the possibility to configure the initial directory.

*Win3xOLibrary* imports Win3xO game references from MEAGRE metadata, derived from the ExoDosLibrary above.
